# Bank Management System

## Overview
This project is a **Bank Management System** developed using **ASP.NET Core** following the **Onion Architecture** pattern. The system efficiently manages employees, departments, projects, locations, and allocations within a bank.

## Features
- Employee management with personal details and department association.
- Department structure with managers and project assignments.
- Project management linked to departments and office locations.
- Multiple bank office locations with assigned departments.
- Allocation system to track employee working hours per project.

## Architecture
This project follows the **Onion Architecture**, which enforces separation of concerns and dependency inversion. The main layers are:

### 1. **Domain Layer** (Core Business Logic)
   - Entities: `Employee`, `Department`, `Project`, `Location`, `Allocation`
   - Interfaces for repository patterns

### 2. **Application Layer** (Service Layer)
   - DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)
   - Service classes (`ProjectService`, `LocationService`, `AllocationService`, etc.)
   - Business rules and validation

### 3. **Infrastructure Layer** (Data Persistence)
   - Implementation of repositories with Entity Framework Core
   - Database configuration and migrations

### 4. **Presentation Layer** (API/Controllers)
   - REST API controllers for each entity
   - Swagger for API documentation

## Technologies Used
- **ASP.NET Core 8.0**
- **Entity Framework Core**
- **SQL Server**
- **Dependency Injection**
- **Swagger (Swashbuckle)**
- **Automapper**
